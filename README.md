8. **`WINE_QUALITY_PREDICTION_END_TO_END_DEPLOYMENT`**  
   - **Description**: An end-to-end machine learning project for predicting wine quality, including data processing, model training, and deployment.  

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains its own files, code, and potentially a dedicated `README.md` with specific instructions. To explore a project:
1. Navigate to the respective sub-directory.
2. Review the contents and any accompanying documentation.
3. Follow setup instructions (if provided) to run or modify the project locally.

## Technologies Used

The projects span a variety of technologies, including:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (e.g., BERT, image classification)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Chatbot Development
- Data Science & Predictive Modeling
- Network Security Tools
- Collaborative Filtering Algorithms

## Purpose

This directory serves as a centralized hub for my work, showcasing my skills in programming, AI, and data science. It’s a living collection that I update as I explore new ideas and technologies.
