# Wine Quality Prediction Project

This is an end-to-end machine learning project designed to predict the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties. The project follows a modular structure with data ingestion, validation, transformation, model training, evaluation, and a prediction pipeline. It uses the "Wine Quality" dataset (specifically `winequality-red.csv`) and is implemented in Python.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the quality of red wine (rated on a scale from 0 to 10) using features such as acidity, alcohol content, pH, and more. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a web interface for predictions.

This project is built using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and Flask. It follows a structured approach with separate components for each stage of the machine learning lifecycle.

## Features
- Data ingestion from a raw dataset (`winequality-red.csv`)
- Data validation to ensure quality and consistency
- Data transformation for preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using a machine learning algorithm
- Model evaluation with performance metrics
- Web interface for real-time predictions

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd complete_end_to_end_project
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the pipeline**:
   Execute the main script to run the entire pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Run the web app**:
   Start the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage
- **Pipeline Execution**: Run `main.py` to execute the full ML pipeline, from data ingestion to model evaluation.
- **Web Interface**: Use the Flask app (`app.py`) to input wine features and get quality predictions.
- **Research**: Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `research/` directory for detailed experimentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `winequality-red.csv`, which contains 1,599 samples of red wine with 11 input features (e.g., fixed acidity, volatile acidity, alcohol) and a quality score (target variable). It is stored in `artifacts/data_ingestion/`.

## Model
The trained model is saved as `model.joblib` in `artifacts/data_trainer/`. The specific algorithm and hyperparameters are defined in `params.yaml` and implemented in `src/datascience/components/model_trainer.py`.

## Results
Model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) are stored in `artifacts/model_evaluation/metrics.json`. Refer to this file for detailed evaluation results.
